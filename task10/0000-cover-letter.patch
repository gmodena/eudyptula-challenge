Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] staging: wimax: fix style check warnings


Fix style warnings reported by checkpatch.pl on op-rfkill.c
by moving */ on a separate line in a block comment,
adding a missing blank line after declarations,
and reformatting a quoted string split across lines.

Resubmitting so that each style warning is addressed in a separate
commit.

This patch is both an attempt to address the warnings, as well as 
a way for me to familiarise with the linux kernel contribution 
process, by following tasks proposed by a popular online challenge.
